# Chords
* Most of the Chords are formulated from the notes of the Major Scale. 
* In the Chord formulae below, the number represent the degree of notes in the Major Scale. 
* Since C Major Scale has no accidentals, it is used as the root note for Chord examples. 

## Major Chord
* Formula: 1 - 3 - 5
* Formed by a Major 3rd (M3) and then a Minor 3rd (m3) intervals above root. 
* The outer notes interval is Perfect 5th (P5). 
* It has a bright and happy tone. 

| Degree           |     I      |     III      |      V       |    Total     |
| ---------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Interval         | root\tonic | 4 half steps | 3 half steps | 7 half steps |
| Interval Quality |            |      M3      |      m3      |      P5      |
| C                |     C      |      E       |      G       |              |

## Minor Chord
* Formula: 1 - 3b - 5
* Formed by reducing the 3rd degree note of Major Chord by half a step.
* The change in tonal quality comes from this change in the note of third degree.
* It has a gloomy and sad tone. 

| Degree           |     I      |   $III_b$    |      V       |    Total     |
| ---------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Interval         | root\tonic | 3 half steps | 4 half steps | 7 half steps |
| Interval Quality |            |      m3      |      M3      |      P5      |
| C                |    $C$     |    $E_b$     |     $G$      |              |

## Diminished Chord
* Formula: 1 - 3b - 5b
* Triad with two minor thirds above the root. 
* The distance between outer chords is Flat fifth. 
* Has a tense, dark and dissonant sound. 

| Degree           |    $I$     |   $III_b$    |    $V_b$     |    Total     |
| ---------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Interval         | root\tonic | 3 half steps | 3 half steps | 6 half steps |
| Interval Quality |            |     $m3$     |     $m3$     |     $b5$     |
| C                |    $C$     |    $E_b$     |    $G_b$     |              |

## Augmented Chord
* Formula: 1 - 3 - #5
* Triad with two major thirds (M3) above the root. 
* The distance between outer chords is Sharp fifth. 
* Interestingly, the interval between the fifth of the chord (#5) and the next root is also M3. 
* Thus, an augmented triad divides the octave into 3 equal parts. 
* Due to this symmetrical nature, there are only 4 unique augmented chord transpositions. 
* Say we want to build a $E+$ triad. The composition of notes in the triad is $E-G\#-B\#$. But the notes in the triad are exactly the same as that in $C+$ triad - $C-E-G\#$. 
* Thus $C+$ in first inversion $(C+/E)$ is the same as $E+$. 
* As such, augmented triads do not really have an identifiable root, at least from the aural perspective. 

| Degree           |    $I$     |    $III$     |    $V_b$     |    Total     |
| ---------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Interval         | root\tonic | 4 half steps | 4 half steps | 8 half steps |
| Interval Quality |            |     $M3$     |     $M3$     |    $\#5$     |
| C+               |    $C$     |     $E$      |    $G\#$     |              |

## Suspended Chord
* Formula: 1 - 2\4 - 5
* Formed by reducing the 3rd degree note of Major Chord by half a step.
* The change in tonal quality comes from this change in the note of third degree.
* It has a gloomy and sad tone. 

| Degree           |     I      |   $III_b$    |      V       |    Total     |
