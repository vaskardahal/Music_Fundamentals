Order of Flats - reverse of Order of Sharps
B ==> E ==> A ==> D ==> G==> C ==> F


Number of Accidentals in Major Scale from Order of Sharps:
1. $C_{Maj}$ (also C) Scale, as a tonic has no accidental (sharp or flat). All notes in the scale are naturals. 
2. Moving forward by the fifth degree, the scale of G has 1 accidental. 
3. That accidental is introduced on the $7^{th}$ note of the Scale, and it is F#. 
4. Moving forward by the fifth degree again, the Scale of D has 2 accidentals. 
	1. The first accidental is the F# itself, retained from the scale of G. 
	2. The new accidental is introduced again on the $7^{th}$ note of the Scale, and that is C#. 
5. Thus, for every clockwise movement in the Circle of Fifths, the additional accidental is added to the $7^{th}$ degree of the scale, while retaining all the accidentals of the previous tonic in the circle.
